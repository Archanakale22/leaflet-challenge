Visualizing Data with Leaflet

This project uses Leaflet, JavaScript, and D3 to show where earthquakes happen based on data from the US Geological Survey (USGS). The USGS studies natural dangers, ecosystems, climate change, and Earth processes. They provide important scientific info.
Leaflet helps make interactive maps. JavaScript manages the data and updates the map. D3 is used to create visual effects, like showing earthquake strengths or locations in a clear way.
By combining these tools, the project makes it easier to understand where earthquakes occur and their impact, using reliable data from the USGS.

Get the Data Set
On the page, you'll find various datasets categorized by earthquake magnitude, timeframe, geographic region, etc. Choose a dataset that interests you. For example, you might select "All Earthquakes in the Past 7 Days" or "Significant Earthquakes in the Past 30 Days".

import and Visualize the Data

Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.
The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color
Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color
Popups that provide additional information about the earthquake were included when a marker is clicked
A legend was created to provide context for the map data
